>     factor' n (p:ps)

>       | otherwise   = factor' n ps

My initial solution used the Sieve of Eratosthenes to calculate the prime numbers,
as can be seen below.

    primes :: Integral a => [a]
    primes = 2 : sieve [3,5..]
      where
        sieve :: Integral a => [a] -> [a]
        sieve (x:xs) = x : sieve (filter (\y -> not (y `divBy` x)) xs)

Upon reading the solutions on [haskell.org](http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Euler_problems/1_to_10#Problem_3)
it seemed that defining `primes` mutually recursive with the factorization function was much more beneficial.

The reason for this is that in the below implementation, a number can be discarded as soon as two of its prime
factors are found---i.e. it's divisable by two of the smaller primes---whereas in the implementation above we
have to check divisability with all smaller primes no matter what.

> primes :: Integral a => [a]
> primes = 2 : filter ((== 1) . length . factor) [3,5..]

> isPrime :: Integral a => a -> Bool
> isPrime n = all (not . divBy n) [2 .. n - 1]
